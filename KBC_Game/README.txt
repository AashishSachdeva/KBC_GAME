Contributions of the team members:
Aashish made doubledip.c and options.c
Aman did 2019B2PS0736P.c
Dharin did 50-50.c and general framework of questions
Overall all the files were made by all in synchronisation, there were equal parts in input validation and iterations
(for ex. displaying  options or  lifelines after it has been used by using controlling variables is common in all functions)
